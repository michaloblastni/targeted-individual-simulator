# Simulator 0.0.0
This project currently needs a feasibility study and a conceptual solution.
It requires exploring what Python EEG libraries can do, and whether there is an AI-based complex event processing.
This Python project will only sense neural activity via EEG and match patterns against rules.
Upon matching a rule, the action from that rule will be executed, i.e. to play an audio message.
The message will play on your computer via its sound card. You will only need to have earplugs or headphones plugged in.

The goal is that the only difference between a targeted individual and a person on the simulator 
should be that a person on the simulator will be able to remove that BCI device to make it stop.
Everything else should strive toward being 100% exactly the same.

When the issue becomes reproducible using a simulator, other people can work toward suggestions that 
may solve it.

Another benefit of this project is that a targeted individual will not have to explain anything.
Instead of explaining, he/she will be able to show this simulator to people and tell them to try it.
Targeted individuals can have this simulator working at home.

As soon as someone will try to use it, they will probably agree themselves that there is someone else behind it 
doing it on purpose due to the content of the messages. It is an electronics.
